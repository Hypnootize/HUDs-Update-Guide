# FIXING THE SPECTATOR ITEM PANELS

We are talking about these panels which can be found inside **resource/ui/Spectator.res** and **resource/ui/SpectatorTournament.res**:

Let's open both our **Spectator.res & SpectatorTournament.res** and let's look for **"itempanel"** 
What we are gonna do is replace our current **"itempanel"** code with the [UPDATED ITEMPANEL CODE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hypnootize/Huds-Update-Guide/master/Files/%5BSpectator%5D%20Item%20Panels.txt)

We might might also want to delete **resource/ui/InspectionPanel** (Item panel for when we inspect players objects) in case it is broken.
