# ADDING A 3D PLAYER MODEL

The 3D Player Model is located in **resource/ui/HudPlayerClass.res**

We can find the code to add a player model [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hypnootize/Huds-Update-Guide/master/Files/%5BHudPlayerClass%5D%20Player%20Model.txt)
Copy the code and add it at the end of the HudPlayerClass file and the playermodel should now show up if it isn't check if *cl_hud_playerclass_use_playermodel* is set *"1"*

If we want to edit it we need to work with the various angles, origin, frame, fov values. Is possible to rotate it vertically, horizontally, make it bigger etcâ€¦ just experiment with the values a bit!
