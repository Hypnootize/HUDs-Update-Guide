# REMOVING OUTDATED AND UNEEDED FILES

Letâ€™s now remove all the files that became useless with the new updates and might cause crashes!

The files we need to remove are:

* MainMenuPlayListEntry.res (if present and outdated makes the game crash 100% of times)
* LobbyContainerFrame.res and LobbyContainerFrame_Casual / Comp / MvM
* LobbyPanel.res and LobbyPanel_Casual / Comp / MvM
* If the Hud is older than 2016 delete every file that starts with "Matchmaking..."

The hud could also crash if an outdated tf_english.txt file is present inside the resource folder.
